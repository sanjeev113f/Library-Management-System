# Library-Management-System

I made this project to make  Library Management System operations a bit easier

A C++ and data structure project to ease the process of managing a
library. Using Binary Indexed Tree and Trie Data Structure. Books
can be added with their name and shelves number(position) . It can
also be checked if a certain book exists or not and its position can be
find out also books positions can be swapped. using BIT number of
books between 2 shelves can find out easily.
